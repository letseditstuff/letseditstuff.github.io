			<h5>This website was built on caffeine and love. But are those two really any different?<br><br>
				As a senior English major, for my Editing 3720 course we were tasked with finding an "ugly document," and editing it to perfection. After pondering for some time as to what I should fix, I realized the answer had been in front of me the whole time.<br><br>
				What's uglier than a text book?<br><br>
				If I was going to edit the shit out of something, and redesign it, I was sure as hell gonna make sure it was something that I was actually going to use. So, I took the reference pages of editors marks from the course's texts, and created the website you see here.<br><br>
				Feel free to use this page, and if you're feeling especially appreciative, you can donate to the <a href="https://www.paypal.me/TheCSC" target="new">Caffeine Fund.</a></h5>
